## Releases

To create a release it is necessary to prepare the project following these steps

#### Create a new version with tag

```
npm version <version>
```

The above command receives as a parameter a specific version such as 1.4.0 or a version type defined by npm's [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) which will automatically increment the number.

These are the available types that can be used as a parameter:

- **Patch** releases: `1.0` or `1.0.x` or `~1.0.4`
- **Minor** releases: `1` or `1.x` or `^1.0.4`
- **Major** releases: `*` or `x`

### Examples

```
npm version 1.4.0
```

```
npm version minor
```

#### Upload the tag to the remote repository

```
git push origin <tag>
```
